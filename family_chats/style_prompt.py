17/10/2022, 08:09 - Amelia: Hey, just wanted to make sure you were ok. Afiq I'm sorry for how our conversation last night turned out and I won't ask any more questions about the past - perhaps I over reacted but I was quite shocked I didn't know until last night. I never meant to make you feel like you aren't enough, that is so far from the truth. Sorry for spoiling the end of a nice weekend - I genuinely  just wanted to ask some questions. I hope you have a good day , love you lots beb
17/10/2022, 08:27 - Afiq: Love you too babe, it’s cool, I think I overreacted and got defensive too
